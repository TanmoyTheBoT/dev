### 2. **Factor Groups**

#### Definition: Factor Group
If $H$ is a normal subgroup of a group $G$, the set of left cosets of $H$ in $G$, denoted $G/H$, forms a group under the operation $(aH)(bH) = abH$. This new group is called the *factor group* (or *quotient group*) of $G$ by $H$.

**Significance**: Factor groups simplify a group’s structure by collapsing each element in a coset of $H$ to a single representative, allowing us to study properties of $G$ through the simpler group $G/H$.

#### **Theorem 9.2**: Factor Groups (O. Hölder, 1889)
If $G$ is a group and $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then $G/H = \{aH \mid a \in G\}$ forms a group under the operation $(aH)(bH) = abH$.

##### **Proof**:
1. **Well-Defined Operation**:
   - For $a, a' \in aH$ and $b, b' \in bH$, we must show $(aH)(bH) = abH$ does not depend on the representatives chosen.
   - Assume $aH = a'H$ and $bH = b'H$, so $a' = ah_1$ and $b' = bh_2$ for some $h_1, h_2 \in H$.
   - Then $a'b' = (ah_1)(bh_2) = a(h_1b)h_2 = abH$, as $H$ is normal. Thus, the operation $(aH)(bH) = abH$ is well-defined.

2. **Group Axioms**:
   - **Associativity** follows directly from $G$’s associativity.
   - **Identity**: The coset $H$ acts as the identity element since $aH = Ha = aH$ for any $a \in G$.
   - **Inverses**: For $aH$, the inverse is $a^{-1}H$, satisfying $(aH)(a^{-1}H) = eH = H$.

Thus, $G/H$ forms a group.

#### **Examples of Factor Groups**

1. **Example 10**: Consider $4\mathbb{Z} = \{0, \pm 4, \pm 8, \dots\} \subset \mathbb{Z}$. The factor group $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$ has four cosets: $0 + 4\mathbb{Z}, 1 + 4\mathbb{Z}, 2 + 4\mathbb{Z}, 3 + 4\mathbb{Z}$, which form a group isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_4$ under addition.

2. **Example 11**: For $G = \mathbb{Z}_{18}$ and $H = \langle 6 \rangle = \{0, 6, 12\}$, the factor group $G/H = \{0 + H, 1 + H, 2 + H, 3 + H, 4 + H, 5 + H\}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_6$.

3. **Example 12**: In the dihedral group $D_4$, let $K = \{R_0, R_{180}\}$, where $R_{\theta}$ denotes a rotation. The factor group $D_4/K$ is constructed by considering cosets of rotations and reflections, and its structure reflects the symmetry and properties of $D_4$ on a simpler level.
