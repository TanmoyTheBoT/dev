Follow this quick guide to back up and restore your qBittorrent data effortlessly.  

### **Backup Process**  
1. Press `Windows + R` to open the Run box.  
2. Enter `%localappdata%\qBittorrent` and hit **Enter** to open the first folder. Minimize it.  
3. Repeat the process, but this time enter `%appdata%\qBittorrent`. Minimize this second folder as well.  
4. Copy all files from each folder and paste them into separate backup folders (e.g., `Local Backup` and `Roaming Backup`) in a secure location.  

### **Restore Process**  
1. Install qBittorrent and close it by pressing `Ctrl + Q`.  
2. Open the `%localappdata%\qBittorrent` folder and delete its contents. Replace them with files from your **Local Backup** folder.  
3. Do the same for `%appdata%\qBittorrent`, replacing the files with your **Roaming Backup** folder.  
4. Launch qBittorrent. Your torrents and settings will be restored.

And you're done! Enjoy your restored setup.
