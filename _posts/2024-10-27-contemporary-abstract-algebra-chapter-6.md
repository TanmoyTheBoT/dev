### Definitions

1. **Group Isomorphism**
   - An isomorphism $\varphi$ from a group $G$ to a group $G'$ is a one-to-one and onto mapping (or function) that preserves the group operation. In formal notation:
     $$
     \varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b) \quad \text{for all } a, b \in G.
     $$
   - If there exists an isomorphism from $G$ onto $G'$, we say that $G$ and $G'$ are **isomorphic** and write $G \approx G'$.

2. **Automorphism**
   - An **automorphism** is an isomorphism from a group $G$ onto itself. This concept is crucial as it highlights symmetries within a single group structure.

3. **Inner Automorphism**
   - Given a group $G$ and an element $a \in G$, the function $\varphi_a$ defined by:
     $$
     \varphi_a(x) = axa^{-1} \quad \text{for all } x \in G
     $$
   is known as the **inner automorphism** of $G$ induced by $a$.

### Theorem 6.1: Properties of Isomorphisms Acting on Elements

Let $\varphi: G \rightarrow G'$ be an isomorphism between two groups $G$ and $G'$. Then, the following properties hold:

1. **Identity Preservation**:
   - **Statement**: $\varphi$ maps the identity of $G$ to the identity of $G'$.
   - **Proof**:
     - Let $e$ be the identity element in $G$ and $e'$ the identity in $G'$.
     - Since $\varphi$ preserves the operation, we have:
       $$
       \varphi(e) = \varphi(e \cdot e) = \varphi(e) \cdot \varphi(e).
       $$
     - By the uniqueness of the identity element in a group, $\varphi(e) = e'$, proving that the identity is preserved.

2. **Power Preservation**:
   - **Statement**: For every integer $n$ and every element $a \in G$, $\varphi(a^n) = [\varphi(a)]^n$.
   - **Proof**:
     - We prove this by induction on $n$.
     - **Base Case** ($n = 0$): $a^0 = e$ in $G$, so $\varphi(a^0) = \varphi(e) = e' = [\varphi(a)]^0$ in $G'$.
     - **Inductive Step** ($n > 0$): Assume $\varphi(a^k) = [\varphi(a)]^k$ for some integer $k$.
       - Then $\varphi(a^{k+1}) = \varphi(a^k \cdot a) = \varphi(a^k) \cdot \varphi(a) = [\varphi(a)]^k \cdot \varphi(a) = [\varphi(a)]^{k+1}$.
       - For negative $n = -m$, we have $a^n = (a^{-1})^m$, so:
         $$
         \varphi(a^n) = \varphi((a^{-1})^m) = [\varphi(a^{-1})]^m = [\varphi(a)^{-1}]^m = [\varphi(a)]^n.
         $$
     - Thus, $\varphi(a^n) = [\varphi(a)]^n$ for all integers $n$, completing the proof.

3. **Commutativity Preservation**:
   - **Statement**: For any $a, b \in G$, $a$ and $b$ commute if and only if $\varphi(a)$ and $\varphi(b)$ commute in $G'$.
   - **Proof**:
     - Suppose $a$ and $b$ commute in $G$, meaning $ab = ba$.
     - Applying $\varphi$, we get $\varphi(ab) = \varphi(ba)$.
     - Since $\varphi$ is operation-preserving, $\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a) \varphi(b)$ and $\varphi(ba) = \varphi(b) \varphi(a)$, so:
       $$
       \varphi(a) \varphi(b) = \varphi(b) \varphi(a).
       $$
     - Conversely, if $\varphi(a)$ and $\varphi(b)$ commute, then $ab = ba$ follows because $\varphi$ is one-to-one and onto, proving commutativity preservation.

4. **Generator Preservation**:
   - **Statement**: If $G = \langle a \rangle$, then $G' = \langle \varphi(a) \rangle$.
   - **Proof**:
     - If $G$ is cyclic with generator $a$, then each element $g \in G$ can be written as $g = a^k$ for some integer $k$.
     - Applying $\varphi$, we have $\varphi(g) = \varphi(a^k) = [\varphi(a)]^k$.
     - Thus, every element of $G'$ is generated by $\varphi(a)$, making $G'$ cyclic with generator $\varphi(a)$, proving that $G' = \langle \varphi(a) \rangle$.

5. **Order Preservation**:
   - **Statement**: $|a| = |\varphi(a)|$ for all $a \in G$.
   - **Proof**:
     - Let $|a| = m$, so $a^m = e$, where $e$ is the identity element in $G$.
     - Applying $\varphi$, we get:
       $$
       \varphi(a^m) = \varphi(e) = e' \quad \Rightarrow \quad [\varphi(a)]^m = e'.
       $$
     - This shows that the order of $\varphi(a)$ divides $m$.
     - Since $\varphi$ is one-to-one, $a$ and $\varphi(a)$ must have the same order, thus $|a| = |\varphi(a)|$.

6. **Solution Count for $x^k = b$**:
   - **Statement**: For a fixed integer $k$ and element $b \in G$, the equation $x^k = b$ has the same number of solutions in $G$ as does $x^k = \varphi(b)$ in $G'$.
   - **Proof**:
     - Let the equation $x^k = b$ have $N$ solutions in $G$, denoted $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N$ such that $x_i^k = b$.
     - Applying $\varphi$, we get $\varphi(x_i^k) = \varphi(b)$, which gives $[\varphi(x_i)]^k = \varphi(b)$ for each $i$, making each $\varphi(x_i)$ a solution to $x^k = \varphi(b)$ in $G'$.
     - Since $\varphi$ is one-to-one, all solutions in $G$ map uniquely to solutions in $G'$, so the number of solutions in $G'$ is also $N$, completing the proof.

7. **Order Preservation for Finite Groups**:
   - **Statement**: If $G$ is finite, then $G$ and $G'$ have exactly the same number of elements of every order.
   - **Proof**:
     - Since isomorphisms preserve element orders (Property 5), each element $a$ in $G$ has a corresponding element $\varphi(a)$ in $G'$ with the same order.
     - Therefore, for any integer $m$, the number of elements of order $m$ in $G$ matches the number of elements of order $m$ in $G'$.
     - Thus, $G$ and $G'$ have identical distributions of element orders if $G$ is finite, completing the proof.

### Theorem 6.2: Properties of Isomorphisms Acting on Groups

Suppose $\varphi: G \rightarrow G'$ is an isomorphism between two groups $G$ and $G'$. Then, the following properties hold:

1. **Inverse Isomorphism**: The inverse function $\varphi^{-1}$ is an isomorphism from $G'$ onto $G$.
2. **Abelianness Preservation**: $G$ is Abelian if and only if $G'$ is Abelian.
3. **Cyclic Structure Preservation**: $G$ is cyclic if and only if $G'$ is cyclic.
4. **Subgroup Preservation**: If $K$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $\varphi(K) = \{ \varphi(k) \mid k \in K \}$ is a subgroup of $G'$.
5. **Subgroup Preservation under Inverse**: If $K'$ is a subgroup of $G'$, then $\varphi^{-1}(K') = \{ g \in G \mid \varphi(g) \in K' \}$ is a subgroup of $G$.
6. **Center Preservation**: $\varphi(Z(G)) = Z(G')$, where $Z(G)$ and $Z(G')$ denote the centers of $G$ and $G'$, respectively.

---

### Proof of Each Property

#### 1. Inverse Isomorphism

- **Statement**: The inverse function $\varphi^{-1}$ is an isomorphism from $G'$ onto $G$.
- **Proof**:
  - Since $\varphi$ is a bijective (one-to-one and onto) function, its inverse $\varphi^{-1}$ exists and maps $G'$ onto $G$.
  - To show $\varphi^{-1}$ is an isomorphism, consider any $a', b' \in G'$ with $a' = \varphi(a)$ and $b' = \varphi(b)$ for some $a, b \in G$.
  - Since $\varphi$ preserves the group operation, we have $\varphi^{-1}(a'b') = \varphi^{-1}(\varphi(a)\varphi(b)) = \varphi^{-1}(\varphi(ab)) = ab = \varphi^{-1}(a')\varphi^{-1}(b')$.
  - Thus, $\varphi^{-1}$ is operation-preserving, confirming it is an isomorphism.

---

#### 2. Abelianness Preservation

- **Statement**: $G$ is Abelian if and only if $G'$ is Abelian.
- **Proof**:
  - Suppose $G$ is Abelian, so $ab = ba$ for all $a, b \in G$.
  - Since $\varphi$ is an isomorphism, it preserves the group operation, so $\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)$ and $\varphi(ba) = \varphi(b)\varphi(a)$.
  - Therefore, $\varphi(a) \varphi(b) = \varphi(b) \varphi(a)$ for all $\varphi(a), \varphi(b) \in G'$, proving $G'$ is Abelian.
  - Conversely, if $G'$ is Abelian, the same argument shows $G$ must also be Abelian.

---

#### 3. Cyclic Structure Preservation

- **Statement**: $G$ is cyclic if and only if $G'$ is cyclic.
- **Proof**:
  - Suppose $G$ is cyclic, generated by an element $a$ so $G = \langle a \rangle$.
  - Every element $g \in G$ can be written as $g = a^k$ for some integer $k$.
  - Since $\varphi$ preserves powers, we have $\varphi(g) = \varphi(a^k) = [\varphi(a)]^k$.
  - Therefore, every element in $G'$ can be written as a power of $\varphi(a)$, showing $G'$ is cyclic with generator $\varphi(a)$.
  - Conversely, if $G'$ is cyclic with generator $b = \varphi(a)$, then every element of $G$ is generated by $a$ due to the onto nature of $\varphi$, proving that $G$ is also cyclic.

---

#### 4. Subgroup Preservation

- **Statement**: If $K$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $\varphi(K) = \{ \varphi(k) \mid k \in K \}$ is a subgroup of $G'$.
- **Proof**:
  - To show $\varphi(K)$ is a subgroup of $G'$, we need to confirm it is closed under the group operation, contains the identity, and contains inverses for its elements.
    - **Closure**: For any $k_1, k_2 \in K$, $k_1 k_2 \in K$, so $\varphi(k_1 k_2) = \varphi(k_1) \varphi(k_2) \in \varphi(K)$, proving closure.
    - **Identity**: Since $e \in K$ (where $e$ is the identity of $G$), $\varphi(e) = e' \in \varphi(K)$ (where $e'$ is the identity of $G'$).
    - **Inverses**: For any $k \in K$, $k^{-1} \in K$, so $\varphi(k^{-1}) = \varphi(k)^{-1} \in \varphi(K)$.
  - Therefore, $\varphi(K)$ is a subgroup of $G'$.

---

#### 5. Subgroup Preservation under Inverse

- **Statement**: If $K'$ is a subgroup of $G'$, then $\varphi^{-1}(K') = \{ g \in G \mid \varphi(g) \in K' \}$ is a subgroup of $G$.
- **Proof**:
  - To verify $\varphi^{-1}(K')$ is a subgroup of $G$, we check closure, identity, and inverses:
    - **Closure**: For $g_1, g_2 \in \varphi^{-1}(K')$, we have $\varphi(g_1), \varphi(g_2) \in K'$ and thus $\varphi(g_1 g_2) = \varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2) \in K'$, so $g_1 g_2 \in \varphi^{-1}(K')$.
    - **Identity**: Since $e' \in K'$ (where $e'$ is the identity in $G'$), we have $e \in \varphi^{-1}(K')$ (where $e$ is the identity in $G$).
    - **Inverses**: For $g \in \varphi^{-1}(K')$, $\varphi(g^{-1}) = \varphi(g)^{-1} \in K'$, so $g^{-1} \in \varphi^{-1}(K')$.
  - Thus, $\varphi^{-1}(K')$ is a subgroup of $G$.

---

#### 6. Center Preservation

- **Statement**: $\varphi(Z(G)) = Z(G')$, where $Z(G)$ and $Z(G')$ denote the centers of $G$ and $G'$, respectively.
- **Proof**:
  - Recall the center of $G$ is $Z(G) = \{ z \in G \mid zg = gz \text{ for all } g \in G \}$.
  - If $z \in Z(G)$, then $z$ commutes with every element of $G$. Applying $\varphi$, we get:
    $$
    \varphi(z) \varphi(g) = \varphi(g) \varphi(z) \quad \text{for all } g \in G.
    $$
    - Thus, $\varphi(z)$ commutes with every element in $G'$, meaning $\varphi(z) \in Z(G')$.
  - Conversely, if $z' \in Z(G')$, then $\varphi^{-1}(z') \in Z(G)$, completing the proof that $\varphi(Z(G)) = Z(G')$.

### Theorem 6.3: Aut(G) and Inn(G) are Groups

#### Statement
The set of all automorphisms of a group $G$, denoted $\text{Aut}(G)$, and the set of all inner automorphisms of $G$, denoted $\text{Inn}(G)$, are both groups under the operation of function composition.

---

### Definitions and Setup

1. **Automorphism**: An automorphism is an isomorphism from a group $G$ onto itself. The set of all automorphisms of $G$ is denoted $\text{Aut}(G)$.
2. **Inner Automorphism**: For an element $a \in G$, the map $\varphi_a : G \rightarrow G$ defined by $\varphi_a(x) = axa^{-1}$ for all $x \in G$ is called the inner automorphism induced by $a$. The set of all inner automorphisms is denoted $\text{Inn}(G)$.

---

### Proof for $\text{Aut}(G)$

To show that $\text{Aut}(G)$ forms a group under composition, we need to verify that it satisfies the group properties: closure, existence of identity, existence of inverses, and associativity.

#### 1. Closure

- Let $\varphi, \psi \in \text{Aut}(G)$, which means both $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are bijective and operation-preserving.
- We need to show that $\varphi \circ \psi \in \text{Aut}(G)$, meaning $\varphi \circ \psi$ is also bijective and operation-preserving.
- **Bijectivity**: Since both $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are bijections, their composition $\varphi \circ \psi$ is also a bijection.
- **Operation Preservation**: For any $a, b \in G$,
  $$
  (\varphi \circ \psi)(ab) = \varphi(\psi(ab)) = \varphi(\psi(a) \cdot \psi(b)) = \varphi(\psi(a)) \cdot \varphi(\psi(b)) = (\varphi \circ \psi)(a) \cdot (\varphi \circ \psi)(b).
  $$
- Thus, $\varphi \circ \psi \in \text{Aut}(G)$, proving closure.

#### 2. Identity

- The identity function $\text{id}_G: G \rightarrow G$, defined by $\text{id}_G(g) = g$ for all $g \in G$, is an automorphism of $G$ since it trivially preserves the group operation.
- Therefore, $\text{id}_G \in \text{Aut}(G)$, satisfying the identity property.

#### 3. Inverses

- For each $\varphi \in \text{Aut}(G)$, there exists an inverse function $\varphi^{-1}$ (since $\varphi$ is bijective) such that $\varphi \circ \varphi^{-1} = \text{id}_G$ and $\varphi^{-1} \circ \varphi = \text{id}_G$.
- **Operation Preservation** for $\varphi^{-1}$: Since $\varphi$ is operation-preserving, for any $a, b \in G$,
  $$
  \varphi^{-1}(ab) = \varphi^{-1}(\varphi(\varphi^{-1}(a)) \cdot \varphi(\varphi^{-1}(b))) = \varphi^{-1}(\varphi(a)) \cdot \varphi^{-1}(\varphi(b)) = \varphi^{-1}(a) \cdot \varphi^{-1}(b),
  $$
  meaning $\varphi^{-1} \in \text{Aut}(G)$.
- Thus, every element in $\text{Aut}(G)$ has an inverse within $\text{Aut}(G)$, confirming the existence of inverses.

#### 4. Associativity

- Since function composition is associative, $\text{Aut}(G)$ inherits associativity under composition.

Since $\text{Aut}(G)$ satisfies closure, identity, inverses, and associativity, it forms a group under function composition.

---

### Proof for $\text{Inn}(G)$

To show that $\text{Inn}(G)$ forms a group, we’ll use similar steps to those used for $\text{Aut}(G)$. Note that $\text{Inn}(G) \subseteq \text{Aut}(G)$, as each inner automorphism is an automorphism.

1. **Definition of $\text{Inn}(G)$**:
   - Each inner automorphism of $G$ is defined by $\varphi_a(x) = axa^{-1}$ for a fixed $a \in G$ and all $x \in G$.
   - The set $\text{Inn}(G) = \{ \varphi_a \mid a \in G \}$ includes all such inner automorphisms.

#### 1. Closure

- For any $\varphi_a, \varphi_b \in \text{Inn}(G)$, their composition $\varphi_a \circ \varphi_b$ is given by:
  $$
  (\varphi_a \circ \varphi_b)(x) = \varphi_a(\varphi_b(x)) = \varphi_a(bxb^{-1}) = abx(b^{-1}a^{-1}) = (ab)x(ab)^{-1}.
  $$
- Since $\varphi_a \circ \varphi_b = \varphi_{ab}$ and $ab \in G$, it follows that $\varphi_a \circ \varphi_b \in \text{Inn}(G)$.
- Therefore, $\text{Inn}(G)$ is closed under composition.

#### 2. Identity

- The identity automorphism $\text{id}_G(x) = x$ for all $x \in G$ is achieved by $\varphi_e(x) = exe^{-1} = x$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$.
- Thus, $\text{id}_G \in \text{Inn}(G)$, satisfying the identity property.

#### 3. Inverses

- For $\varphi_a \in \text{Inn}(G)$, the inverse function is $\varphi_{a^{-1}}$, since:
  $$
  \varphi_a \circ \varphi_{a^{-1}}(x) = \varphi_a(a^{-1} x a) = aa^{-1} x a^{-1} a = x.
  $$
- Therefore, $\varphi_a^{-1} = \varphi_{a^{-1}} \in \text{Inn}(G)$, confirming that each element in $\text{Inn}(G)$ has an inverse in $\text{Inn}(G)$.

#### 4. Associativity

- Since $\text{Inn}(G)$ is a subset of $\text{Aut}(G)$, it inherits associativity from function composition.

Since $\text{Inn}(G)$ satisfies closure, identity, inverses, and associativity, it forms a group under function composition.

Let’s proceed with a detailed, step-by-step proof of **Theorem 6.4: Aut($\mathbb{Z}_n$) ≈ $U(n)$**, ensuring each element is rigorously verified.

---

### Theorem 6.4: Aut($\mathbb{Z}_n$) ≈ $U(n)$

#### Statement
For every positive integer $n$, the automorphism group of the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$, denoted $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$, is isomorphic to the group of units $U(n)$ under multiplication modulo $n$. Here, $U(n)$ consists of all integers less than $n$ that are coprime to $n$.

---

### Proof

#### Step 1: Define and Characterize $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$

1. **Structure of $\mathbb{Z}_n$**:
   - $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is the group of integers $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n - 1\}$ under addition modulo $n$.
   - Since $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a cyclic group, it has a generator, namely $1$, meaning every element in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ can be expressed as $k \cdot 1$ for some integer $k$.

2. **Automorphisms of $\mathbb{Z}_n$**:
   - An automorphism $\varphi \in \text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$ is a bijective homomorphism from $\mathbb{Z}_n$ onto itself, preserving the group operation.
   - Since $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is generated by $1$, each automorphism $\varphi$ is determined by its action on $1$ alone. For any $x \in \mathbb{Z}_n$, we can write $x = k \cdot 1$ for some $k$, so:
     $$
     \varphi(x) = \varphi(k \cdot 1) = k \cdot \varphi(1).
     $$
   - To be an automorphism, $\varphi(1)$ must also generate $\mathbb{Z}_n$, meaning $\varphi(1)$ should be an element of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ that is **coprime to $n$**. Otherwise, $\varphi$ would fail to be onto.

3. **Generators of $\mathbb{Z}_n$**:
   - The elements of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ that generate the group are precisely those that are coprime to $n$, as only such elements have orders that cover all integers modulo $n$.
   - Thus, $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$ consists of automorphisms $\varphi_k$ defined by mapping $1$ to each element $k \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ such that $\gcd(k, n) = 1$.

#### Step 2: Define $T: \text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_n) \rightarrow U(n)$

To establish an isomorphism, we’ll construct a bijective homomorphism $T$ from $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$ to $U(n)$, showing they are structurally identical.

1. **Definition of $T$**:
   - For each $\varphi \in \text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$, define $T(\varphi) = \varphi(1)$.
   - Since $\varphi(1)$ is coprime to $n$, $T(\varphi) \in U(n)$ (by the structure of $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$ derived above).
   - We aim to prove that $T$ is a bijective homomorphism, thereby establishing an isomorphism between $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$ and $U(n)$.

2. **Homomorphism Property**:
   - Let $\varphi_k, \varphi_m \in \text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$ be automorphisms such that $T(\varphi_k) = k$ and $T(\varphi_m) = m$, where $k, m \in U(n)$.
   - We claim that $T(\varphi_k \circ \varphi_m) = T(\varphi_k) \cdot T(\varphi_m)$ in $U(n)$.
   - For any $x \in \mathbb{Z}_n$, we have:
     $$
     (\varphi_k \circ \varphi_m)(x) = \varphi_k(\varphi_m(x)).
     $$
   - Applying this to $1 \in \mathbb{Z}_n$:
     $$
     T(\varphi_k \circ \varphi_m) = (\varphi_k \circ \varphi_m)(1) = \varphi_k(\varphi_m(1)) = \varphi_k(m) = k \cdot m.
     $$
   - Therefore, $T(\varphi_k \circ \varphi_m) = k \cdot m = T(\varphi_k) \cdot T(\varphi_m)$, proving that $T$ preserves the group operation.

#### Step 3: Proving $T$ is a Bijective Mapping

1. **Injectivity**:
   - Suppose $T(\varphi_k) = T(\varphi_m)$ for two automorphisms $\varphi_k, \varphi_m \in \text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$. Then $T(\varphi_k) = k$ and $T(\varphi_m) = m$, so $k = m$.
   - Since $\varphi_k$ and $\varphi_m$ are both determined by their action on $1$ and $k = m$, it follows that $\varphi_k = \varphi_m$.
   - Thus, $T$ is injective.

2. **Surjectivity**:
   - Let $k \in U(n)$. Define $\varphi_k: \mathbb{Z}_n \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_n$ by $\varphi_k(x) = kx \mod n$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Z}_n$.
   - Since $k$ is coprime to $n$, $\varphi_k$ is bijective, meaning $\varphi_k \in \text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$.
   - Moreover, $T(\varphi_k) = k$, so every $k \in U(n)$ corresponds to some automorphism in $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$, proving that $T$ is surjective.

Since $T$ is a bijective homomorphism, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_n) \approx U(n)$.

### Theorem 6.5: Cayley’s Theorem

#### Statement
Every group $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group on $G$. In other words, every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.

---

### Proof of Cayley’s Theorem

To prove Cayley’s Theorem, we’ll construct an injective homomorphism from $G$ into the symmetric group $S_G$, the group of all permutations on the set $G$. We do this by associating each element of $G$ with a permutation (specifically, a left multiplication map).

#### Step 1: Define Left Multiplication Maps

For each element $g \in G$, define a function $T_g: G \rightarrow G$ by:
$$
T_g(x) = gx \quad \text{for all } x \in G.
$$
This function $T_g$ represents left multiplication by $g$.

#### Step 2: Show that Each $T_g$ is a Permutation

1. **Injectivity of $T_g$**:
   - Suppose $T_g(x) = T_g(y)$ for some $x, y \in G$. Then:
     $$
     gx = gy.
     $$
   - By multiplying both sides on the left by $g^{-1}$ (the inverse of $g$), we get $x = y$.
   - Therefore, $T_g$ is injective.

2. **Surjectivity of $T_g$**:
   - For any $y \in G$, let $x = g^{-1}y$. Then:
     $$
     T_g(x) = g(g^{-1}y) = y.
     $$
   - This shows that $T_g$ maps onto $G$, making $T_g$ a bijection (both injective and surjective).
   - Since $T_g$ is a bijective map from $G$ to itself, it is a **permutation** of $G$.

Therefore, each $T_g$ is an element of the symmetric group $S_G$, the group of all permutations on $G$.

#### Step 3: Define a Map $\Phi: G \rightarrow S_G$

Define $\Phi: G \rightarrow S_G$ by setting $\Phi(g) = T_g$ for each $g \in G$. We aim to show that $\Phi$ is an injective homomorphism, thus establishing an isomorphism between $G$ and a subgroup of $S_G$.

#### Step 4: Show that $\Phi$ is a Homomorphism

1. **Operation Preservation**:
   - For any $g, h \in G$, consider $\Phi(g) \circ \Phi(h)$. By definition:
     $$
     \Phi(g) \circ \Phi(h) = T_g \circ T_h.
     $$
   - For any $x \in G$, $(T_g \circ T_h)(x) = T_g(T_h(x))$.
     - First, $T_h(x) = hx$.
     - Then, $T_g(hx) = g(hx) = (gh)x$.
   - Thus,
     $$
     (T_g \circ T_h)(x) = T_{gh}(x).
     $$
   - This implies that $T_g \circ T_h = T_{gh}$, so:
     $$
     \Phi(g) \circ \Phi(h) = \Phi(gh).
     $$
   - Therefore, $\Phi$ is a homomorphism.

#### Step 5: Show that $\Phi$ is Injective

1. **Injectivity of $\Phi$**:
   - Suppose $\Phi(g) = \Phi(h)$ for some $g, h \in G$. Then $T_g = T_h$, which means that for all $x \in G$,
     $$
     T_g(x) = T_h(x).
     $$
   - Thus, $gx = hx$ for all $x \in G$. In particular, if we set $x = e$ (the identity element of $G$), we have:
     $$
     g \cdot e = h \cdot e \Rightarrow g = h.
     $$
   - Therefore, $\Phi$ is injective.

#### Step 6: Conclude that $\Phi(G)$ is a Subgroup of $S_G$

Since $\Phi$ is an injective homomorphism from $G$ into $S_G$, the image $\Phi(G) = \{ T_g \mid g \in G \}$ is isomorphic to $G$ and is a subgroup of $S_G$.


### Example 1: Cayley’s Theorem Applied to $\mathbb{Z}_3$

Consider the group $\mathbb{Z}_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}$ under addition modulo 3.

1. **Defining the Group Elements**:
   - The group $\mathbb{Z}_3$ has three elements: $0, 1,$ and $2$, where the operation is addition modulo 3.

2. **Left Multiplication Maps**:
   - For each element $a \in \mathbb{Z}_3$, define $T_a: \mathbb{Z}_3 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_3$ by $T_a(x) = a + x$ (mod 3). These maps represent the left multiplication (or addition) by each element.
   - **Calculating $T_a$ for each element $a$:**
     - $T_0(x) = 0 + x$, so $T_0 = (0, 1, 2) \rightarrow (0, 1, 2)$ (the identity permutation).
     - $T_1(x) = 1 + x$:
       - $T_1(0) = 1$,
       - $T_1(1) = 2$,
       - $T_1(2) = 0$,
       - Thus, $T_1 = (0, 1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2, 0)$.
     - $T_2(x) = 2 + x$:
       - $T_2(0) = 2$,
       - $T_2(1) = 0$,
       - $T_2(2) = 1$,
       - So, $T_2 = (0, 1, 2) \rightarrow (2, 0, 1)$.

3. **Permutation Representations**:
   - We now have the following permutation representations for each element in $\mathbb{Z}_3$:
     - $T_0 = (1)(2)(3)$ (identity),
     - $T_1 = (0 1 2)$,
     - $T_2 = (0 2 1)$.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Under Cayley's Theorem, the group $\mathbb{Z}_3$ is isomorphic to the subgroup of permutations generated by $T_1 = (0 1 2)$ and $T_2 = (0 2 1)$, forming a permutation group.

### Example 2: Cayley’s Theorem Applied to $D_3$, the Symmetry Group of a Triangle

Consider $D_3$, the dihedral group representing the symmetries of an equilateral triangle, with elements $e, r, r^2, s, rs, r^2s$.

1. **Defining the Elements and Operations**:
   - $D_3$ consists of:
     - $e$: identity (no change),
     - $r$: rotation by $120^\circ$,
     - $r^2$: rotation by $240^\circ$,
     - $s$: reflection across a vertical axis,
     - $rs$: reflection across another axis,
     - $r^2s$: reflection across the third axis.
   - The operation in $D_3$ is the composition of these transformations.

2. **Left Multiplication Maps**:
   - For each $g \in D_3$, define $T_g: D_3 \rightarrow D_3$ by $T_g(x) = gx$.
   - **Calculating $T_g$ for each element $g$:**
     - $T_e(x) = ex = x$: $T_e$ is the identity permutation.
     - $T_r(x) = r \cdot x$:
       - $T_r(e) = r$,
       - $T_r(r) = r^2$,
       - $T_r(r^2) = e$,
       - $T_r(s) = rs$,
       - $T_r(rs) = r^2s$,
       - $T_r(r^2s) = s$,
       - Thus, $T_r$ corresponds to a permutation that cycles $e, r, r^2$ and $s, rs, r^2s$.
     - Similar calculations for $T_{r^2}, T_s, T_{rs}, T_{r^2s}$ yield other permutations.

3. **Permutation Representations**:
   - Each transformation in $D_3$ corresponds to a unique permutation of the six elements, and composing these transformations mirrors the group operation in $D_3$.
   - This mapping is an isomorphism between $D_3$ and a permutation group on six elements, showing that $D_3$ can be represented as a group of permutations.
